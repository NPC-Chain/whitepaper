 Foreword
About NPC(Neutral Finance Chain)
NPC dedicate to propose a decentralized financial ecology including technical framework, application framework, community framework. It doesn’t set any centralized organizations to restrict ecology, instead it offers tools and standards to global technical volunteer and community volunteer to help them develop all kinds of applications and communities. With the joint efforts of NPC spiritual super volunteer around the world, it will build a decentralized financial ecology with complete bottom layer, plentiful applications and prosperous community. It will eventually formed a super DAPP which indeed realized decentralization, transparency, right and information symmetry, ecology autonomy, community win-win. 

一、Background
1.1 NPC in Game Ecology
NPC which is short for Non-Player-Character is a role type, usually means non player character. It’s a game role which cannot be controlled by game player and born of console game, later be applied into other game territory gradually. Normally NPC will drop out some props to provide some game information or trigger some plot for players.
Due to the importance and obscure personality of NPC, in the internet, people make a definition of NPC spirit, such as player has some passive personality with plenty of merits. They rarely initiate to communicate with others, however, once someone need any help, they will guide the player mission clue, commodity purchasing, game play strategy and so many help.
NPC spirit is the affirmation for the personality and ability. They are glad and capable of help others without any return. In any industry, we all need people and organizations has the NPC spirit. Their professional integrity is about all for the ecology, all for the player, I’d like to provide guides for player day by day and become the stepping-stone to help the player grow into master.
1.2 Blockchain Industry Bottle Neck
Blockchain project usually have three parts which are technique, organization and finance.
For technique part, blockchain is a distributed database, exists in block and chain forms. With the development of DAG, Libra, it’s no longer limited to block.
For organization part, from technical P2P to organizational communitization, blockchain emphasize on organizational and open-type development.
In finance part, digital currency in blockchain form cash, stocks, options and multi financial features to bear the weight of digital finance times.
Blockchain market had rapid expansion from 2016 to 2017. In 2018, there are more blockchain projects with problems appearing, such as technological development shutoff, platform collapsed, technology solution cannot be realized and so on. All these problems led to blockchain bear market from 2018 till now. At the mean time, there are two phenomenon appeared in blockchain market worth attention: 
1）Public chain landing suffered: more public chain pop up on main net, instead of creating more landing scenario and users, its declining. 
2）Blockchain project’s transparency is worse than blockchain technology. The higher technology research and development cost, promising technology failure, complicated cash flow, no clue development plan, would arise community’s concern to the project.
1.3 NPC in Blockchain Ecology
Through the baptism of 2017 and 2018 bear market, the blockchain industry become rational. With the increasing appreciation of global government and financial industry, the real blockchain applications will land fast and more organizations as well as people will participate in the technique and ecology construction of blockchain.
Look back to the bull market before 2018 and bull market after 2018, we would find out that the essence change of industry is there are plenty of geeks and open-source organizations with NPC spirit in the industry. In the open source platform Satoshi Nakamoto contributed, they put ecology and technique development as their own duty, not for profit, to iterative technique and develop communities which make the rapid progress of blockchain technology and digital currency consensus in those years.
From the World Wide Web assumption raised by Tim Berners-Lee the father of internet till the publish of <Bitcoin: A peer to peer electronic cash system> by Satoshi Nakamoto, history is always striking similarity. These geek pioneers full of innovate and open source spirit pushed the wheel of the age and showed the foresight and sagacity epoch-making. The born of the internet brought people into a new age, the high speed and interconnect information network connect everyone closely around the world, eliminate the gap between the time and place. The born of blockchain overturn the internat age and change the traditional labor productive relations, lower the society trust cost enormous. We believe under the NPC and open source spirit, blockchain will give more in the world stage.
1.4 NPC in Finance Ecology
The openings of modern financial industry started from the Wall Street. Smart Americans used bonds to build the Erie Canal through New York to Great Lakes, fund-raising for military expenditure in War between the States. These assets, equity, credit all become finance and everyone is win-win at that time.
Through long time historical development, financial industry changed from singular form to various forms of financial institution systems. The grass root class appeared in this process. Since financial demand and need hand upside down, the wealthy people had the best and excess financial service, the grass root class need the financial service most had no way to access to it. Although ordinary people able to get into corporate finance, financial products transactions, equity investment and some other financial activities. However the features of capital and deep-rooted bad habits made grass root class finance get severe question. Greedy capitalist usually damaged grass roots profit or treated them unfair. Such as setting extremely high investment threshold from ordinary people for some good investment, using information opacity to charge high agency fee, providing financial service for specific users instead of the majority. There is no neutrality, no fair, no symmetry, no NPC.These are all typical problems faced by modern financial market. 
二 Decentralized Finance
2.1 DeFi-Blockchain rigid demand appliactions
Decentralized Finance, short for DeFi, using decentralized technology and financial features of digital currency to start the business.
Traditional Fintech is centralized confidence mechanism. First, the operation of Fintech project is based on certain company’s software, which is controlled and examined by centralized agency(company), so user have no choice but to fully trust the centralized agency. However, some centralized agency might damage user’s profit in some aspect, or treat them unfair. Some good investment might set high threshold from the ordinary, use unclear information to charge middle expense, choose to provide service for some certain clients and make most clients unable to access to the financial service, like in some underdeveloped African countries.
Compared to centralized Fintech, DeFi’s essence is that it’s a open source software, no access permission, no centralized agency. Users won’t be treated differently or have the price discrimination, service discrimination, the whole system will open to all users to provide better service. DeFi will bring freedom to the developers to become a magnet for them. On our aspect of view, the realization of future inclusive finance and DeFi will be inseparable.
We noticed, since the blockchain Bretton Woods whitepaper, to the construction of Libra, the international blockchain project organizers concern most about how to apply blockchain to AFILA underdeveloped finance with related financial service. No doubt, this financial service is decentralized, is DeFi.
Since the invention of smart contract, DeFi is the rare rigid demand DAPP. With the global economy on the slide, many underdeveloped countries use capital control and inflation to bring huge disaster to the grass root users who is lack of financial instruments. The changeable exchange rates, the soaring living cost made AFILA underdeveloped countries live in the cruel world.
Under the circumstances, DeFi is the basic financial infrastructure  for daily production. With the recession of developed countries economy, DeFi is also rigid demand for them. Many Europe and America countries use negative interest rate to postpone recession. Negative interest rate is the saving tax which recently influence bond yield, but will finally lead to consumption finance and personal account and form economic storm over the whole world.
DeFi will become the wealth refuge under the negative interest rate conditions. The decentralized DeFi debit and credit might be influenced by negative interest rate, lead to excess asset supply and lack of demand in the platform. However DeFi cannot be controlled by central bank monetary policy, the extreme condition would be like low loan rate. In the decentralized asset management platform, users don’t need to pay for asset custody expense.
DeFi will be the product of the age.
2.2 DeFi which grow exponentially faster
Decentralized financial business will be formed as smart contract or a group of smart contracts on blockchain. In that sense, DeFi is DAPP and related protocol in financial field.
Except for the decentralized financial characteristic, smart contract also has the code’s technique characteristic. In the public chain, a DeFi contract could be reuse naturally, and it will bring the composability which makes DeFi grow exponentially faster and the singular point is in the near future.
In brief, developers could use other’s protocol like Lego, create new protocol and applications diverse to different product’s user group. It provides great, strong, dependable smart contract and DeFi service, as well as centralized financial products class user experience.
The composability and mobility of DeFi components is the important moat of blockchain DeFi ecology, so the developers could do the DeFi application tests with nearly zero cost. Not only code and function is composable, but also the user pool and asset. The composability make DeFi competitors into close shield brother, the enhance of composability improve the practicability of blockchain internet. The composability create great synergistic effect of positive externality and ecology which make the value of DeFi ecology is much bigger than the total DeFi component.
The combination of layer 1 DeFi and layer 2 DEX components with price prediction component, will bring the digital and DeFi of global assets.
In our opinion, DeFi platform constitutes of contracts will grow into component factory, which will produce new DeFi components and support other component producer to have the chain explosive reaction.
We affirm the ecology of blockchain and DeFi will soon reach development inflection point. From the linear growth into exponential growth, the singular point of DeFi explosion is on the way, the miracle will soon arrive.
2.3 Major matters confronted by DeFi
Nowadays, DeFi projects have two choke points. 
One is the asset choke point. For assets, no matter original assets on chain or traditional assets on chain, there are many difficulties. For the original assets on chain which need cross-chain infrastructure. WBTC’s practice has proved quality on chain assets except from Ethereum is hard ro access into it such as BTC. When we make assets on chain, we strongly depend on decentralized oracle machine. Nowadays, decentralized oracle machine such as ChainLink, Dos Network is on the way, has not been applied in market. Some small company like to choose centralized oracle machine, and since they haven’t accumulate enough credibility, and choose the centralized plan, they are hard to gain trust from community.
The other choke pain is technique. The usage of DeFi projects is quite complicated and require high technical reserve. Such as MakerDao, when user want to create CDAPP, they need to login MakerDao website, enter command line to create related contract and lock assets under the smart contract. All these steps are hard for the ordinary user and many users won’t be able to use it. All these is opposite to the original intention of DeFi which is no threshold, and service for original user who cannot have good experience in traditional centralized financial system. Frankly speaking, who could lower the technique threshold, provide more convenient and simple service to the community user will be in the lead of DeFi long distance race.
NPC dedicated to solve these two chock points. NPC dedicate to propose a distributed financial ecology including technical framework, application framework, community framework. It doesn’t set any centralized organizations to control this ecology, instead it offers tools and standards to global technical volunteer and community volunteer to help them develop all kinds of applications and communities. With the joint efforts of NPC spiritual super volunteer around the world, it will build a decentralized financial ecology with complete bottom layer, plentiful applications and prosperous community. It will eventually formed a super DAPP which indeed realized decentralization, transparency, right and information symmetry, ecology autonomy, community win-win. 
三、NPC Economic Model
3.1 NPCP
NPC adopt dual layer economic model which could be divided into two types of token by the management authority. Ecology Point: NPC Point. Community Equity: NPC Coin.
Ecology point NPC Point is joint ownership of whole ecology community. Community equity NPC Coin will be issued voluntarily by super volunteer in different governance organizations around the world.
NPC Point is the general ecological points which is measured by community construction. The starting point of using NPC Point is to add the stable measure mechanism in the blockchain and it has a quantize and accurate measurement for community flow. 
NPC Point plan to issue 10 billion NPCP token after the major network online and ecology integration. Community conversion 70%, ecology fund 10%, technique volunteer governance committee 10%, community volunteer governance committee 10%.
3.2 NPCC
Community equity NPC Coin is the equity token of all communities and as the prove of DeFi business which could generate value. It could be used to collect funds, share ecology construction achievements, governance voting, sharing, mutual help and back feed value for NPC Point. It could record the revenue sharing on NPC Point internet, and as well as circulate and cross chain on ETH and other mainstream public chains.
NPC Coin will be published in due time according to the business stage of different communities. The price, amount, allocation plan will all be mapped out by community initiator and it will be co-governance by different communities. To make the future ecology integration standards become relatively unified, the name of tokens which is issued by communities as NPCC, the issuing amount will be 200 million, the issuing price will be 0.15usdt, and it will be released gradually by the development of community population.
四、Ecological Business Scenario
DeFi ecology in NPC different communities will be chose by NPC Token community governance voting raised by super volunteers. We could give some application forms which including token, loan, decentralized exchange and related derivatives.
4.1 Token
Token includes original token and asset backed anchoring token. The former could create BTC, ETH based on the blockchain ecology, the latter anchor the real world asset, such as USDT, all kinds of STO, securities on chain. These two has no big difference in nature, since token has the multi financial features in blockchain as cash, potions, securities, and all these financial features will be confirmed by token essence.
With the development of blockchain industry, many token’s issuing mode is getting mature. STO is a good mode that NPC is optimistic about it. Through legal and compliance supervision, STO could help company to autonomously finish security token offering which represents the leading edgy of blockchain business scenario.
4.2 Blockchain Debit and Credit
Blockchain Debit and Credit project contains three modes including:
1）P2P make a match mode. The platform match counter party for debit and credit. The represent project is Dharma, the longest debit and credit cycle is 90 days, the loan interest is fixed. Fund will be locked in the lending time, and once match the borrower, the interest start to count.
2）Capital pool mode, also called auto market making. Capital pool will be the debit and credit counterparty, algorithm will offer the interest rate during the fluctuation of demand and supply in capital pool. The represent project is Compound, it doesn’t set fixed length of maturity, 
3）Stable currency mode. The represent project is MakerDAO. This is the DeFi field project with the largest asset size, user could create Dai by pledging ETH on the platform, it also support other assets pledging. 
4.3 DeFi Trading Platform
Business and exchange will be realized on chain decentralized which will be called DEX, mainly has three modes: 
1）Indent mode shows order flow from seller and buyer, which is suitable for high fluidity market. According to whether make a match or settle accounts is on chain, and has narrower categories. 
2）Capital pool mode, also called Automated market makers Trading. There is no order flow, all fluidity is in the smart contract and close the deal by set arithmetic. Represent project are Bancor, Uniswap.
3）Netherlands auction mode, with the lower offer by exchange till all tokens sold out, each buyer will get token at the same closing price. Represent project are Duntchx protocol, FairDE.
NPC will use DEX to explore new private placement or crowd funding way. New transaction mode will effectively realize private placement system of token business, which will be a core content of blockchain. Our vision is to butt joint any DAPP formed private placement innovative manner to realize high efficiency fund raising by DEX.
For all the scenarios, NPC community has relevant technique and business accumulation and through NPC to form assembly effect.
4.4 Staking (Pledge-style Economy)
Staking is the specific behavior in the POS (proof of stake) consensus projects, which means the token holder pledge token to get Staking reward investment behavior and gain certain revenue due to the equity.
Token holder (common investor/institutional investor) who want to gain the Staking reward need to choose a node which could be the wallet, exchange, third party operator to delegate, or build a own node and through pledging, voting, delegation, locking to gain transaction fee, block reward, dividend and other Staking rewards. Hence, Staking could be easily understood as a commercial industry with hold token to bear interest, pledge token to mining or lock token to mining.
From the distribution of applications from global agencies, Staking economic mode is obvious preferred by wallet and exchange, due to its natural technique advantage could enhance user stickiness. So we would like to suggest communities to issue a Staking public chain, wallet or exchange independently and could guide Staking mechanism into other financial business mode as a supplement.
4.5 Mutual Finance
Mutual finance platform is the platform created by fund flow, it will eventually be used by investment or other projects. This mutual help itself will bear interest and the interest margin will become the main business income or charge certain proportional commission fee. If borrower uses it for project investment, the borrower’s ROI will be used for paying interest or dividends. 
Another form of mutual finance is using insurance. It is organizer voluntary by people who has the common needs and facing the same risks. It is a insurance form of prepay compensation for risks and losses. This form of mutual help exists in the mutual help organizations aimed for financial compensation ancient and modern.
No matter what type of mutual finance, it used to become the money-making methods by malevolence when there is no blockchain technique especially no DeFi technique. Through blockchain technique, we think mutual help itself once open its characteristics of transparency and tamper proof, it will develop the positive effects whether the reason of mutual help is for stock investment, secondary market funds or other capital operations.
五、Project Roadmap
Research and development of NPC is the medium term and long term planning. In the development of NPC in the future, we will according to the following principles:
1．	Developer team will build library on Github to supply the basic bottom layer and application technique framework as reference.
2．	Code and applications will complete gradually and highly rely on NPC community existing technique volunteer.
3．	Developer team will use the public chain infrastructure maximum to lower the development cost and adopt MVP method to develop available version with minimum cost and iteration rapidly.
4．	Developer team will focus on community need s to form consensus as the target.
5．	From the beginning to the future, NPC will guarantee the maximum flow community has the highest voice.

六、Management Structure
From separation of the three powers philosophy to BFT consensus two thirds majority, the balance of rights in governance structure is the map from reality to ideal. Based on that, the governance work of NPC will be in charge of self-governance committee, NPC community foundation and NPC community. These three parties will develop NPC in a coordinated way to accelerate NPC ecological construction.
6.1 Self-governance Committee
Based on core spirit of blockchain decentralization, we set up decentralized organizational self-governance committee which has three divisions: decision making committee, supervising committee, promotion committee. The tenure of each term of committee is 4 months, at the end of tenure, community will adopt community voting to whether reappoint committee members or not.
Decision making committee
In charge of modifying management constitution, hiring or dismissing leader in committees, formulating and modifying significant principles;
Supervising committee
In charge of investigating market data, supervising project progress, finding wrong information and helping to correct;
Promotion committee
In charge of production promotion, butt joint all kinds of resources, building NPC brand, company culture, establishing and perfecting all types of management principles and public relation.
6.2 NPC Self-Governance Community
NPC community consists of technology team, business team and volunteer team. They come from different countries and have the same value of NPC decentralized community to participate in the project, community work including but not limited to: NPC code contribution, NPC business mode contribution, NPC financial resources contribution and volunteer will do the poster design to broadcast the common concept, edit platform content, plan activities, promote online and offline projects and so on.
Community management structure suggests to refer the structure of NPC self government. NPC is a complete open and decentralized project, it will finish different communities integration and complete governance authority transaction. Thus the management power of NPC self government especially the super community management team is the most important property in NPC ecology.
 6.3 Foundation donated by Communities
The fundamental objective of NPC community donating foundation is for compliance as a non-profit organization. With DAO blockchain value, community will finish the foundation construction in neutral countries and regions though spontaneously donation.
Other than other blockchain foundation, NPC foundation will not do the mandatory plan for project, it will be supervised by community and be responsibility for community, implement the value as consensus, co creation, co sharing, co winning. Through community negotiation, topic voting to finish the building and healthy developing for NPC ecology, these will provide proper protection and effective communication channel for NPC ecology community members.

七、Team
NPC team is an international team which consists of financial talents and blockchain talents worldwide. Financial talents from global financial institutions, world bank, IMF, BIS and senior executives from European and American banks.
Blockchain and DeFi teams from Musk Rocket team, Google AI research institution, Russian cryptology geek team and other global teams. Now these teams are in accordance with open source organization principle to join NPC community and carry out extensive research and construction work.
NPC has the following concepts :
NPC’s commin goal is to build a self governance community which is recognized by global blockchain developers, solve global financial problems and build decentralized finance.
The peculiarity, technique and community landing combines perfectly in NPC.
NPC choose one step to finish DeFi and traditional financial business aggregation.
NPC finish DeFi construction on chain, through cross chain protocol to form extensive token issuing and circulation, accomplishing financial users and assets transform.
NPC completely obey DAO self governance mode.
八、System Design
8.1 Position
As mentioned above, two choke points in DeFi is asset transform and user threshold. Recent Libra project represents solution route for these two choke points from blockchain industry.
Libra use extensive industry alliance to constitute asset transforming blockchain entrance and through wallet Calibra to lower the user threshold.
The aiming of NPC and solution of Libra lead to Rome destination.
First of all, the main issues we faced in blockchain business is that wallet and blockchain are the fundamental applications and exchange is separate.
Wallet as the entrance of chain, suppose to be the entrance of all people master their digital wealth, however, exchange doesn’t form in  wallet. Due to the blockchain isomerism of centralized exchange from decentralization, it adds unnecessary digital currency circulation process. Even though the efficiency of make-a-match has improved, it greatly increase the user’s access threshold and cause safety problem of user asset structure and cannot show the advantage of decentralized blockchain ecology DAPP cooperation. The popular of centralized exchange, keep user flow under control and make the mode of wallet plus DAPP into weak position.
NPC think building decentralized exchange will form the integrative development with multi chain wallet to form assembly effect in ecology and that’s the only road of blockchain ecology.
At the same time we noticed if the business in DEX has carried out on public chain completely, the over cost of blockchain technology and the realization of technique is complicated.
After the investigation and survey of many public chain projects, NPC think dual layer blockchain system is suitable for the construction of DEX. Dual layer blockchain could realize decentralization and cost reduction. Through cross chain relay （Cassni，IBC protocal）to realize the cross chain link of many public chains. It also solve the problem of efficiency and transparency of decentralization. In the public chain ecology, the open multi chain wallet resource is abundant and these all provide solid foundation for NPC.
NPC also pay attention to ETH, COSMOS, these projects latest token issuing technology and cross chain technology development.
8.2 Characters
NPC network has two main participation roles: business participator and service provider.
Business participator
Business participator is the user and investor of DEX. Business participator could through business mining to gain NPC token and exchange operation bonus and realize the inspiration of community growth.
Service provider
Blockchain service provider provide two types of service. One is the support of basic blockchain operation, the other is service of wallet, transaction, contracts, and make a match based on blockchain.
Obviously, to decentralized blockchain system, service provider is also the business participator in a deeper level.
NPC network business participator and service provider could through community voting mechanism to switch. Any business participator could apply for the service provider. Any service provider could quit its role by community rules.
8.3 Community and Business Layering
As previous mentioned, NPC choose one step to finish DeFi and traditional financial business aggregation. The NPC chain could finish DeFi construction , through cross chain protocol to form extensive token issuing and circulation, transformation of financial user and assets. The maximum and effective usage of existing blockchain infrastructure is to reach the aim of promoting DeFi business growth.
8.4 Blockchain Related Knowledge
The structure of NPC exchange is based on dual layer chain. So we listed underlying blockchain basic theory. Reader could choose to read this chapter or not by their interests.
NPC doesn’t restrict technical base in it, with the open blockchain spirit to choose and storage technique cooperation platform.
8.4.1 Dual Layer Blockchain and Dual Layer Blockchain Structure
Dual layer blockchain is a scalable dual layer system, which is divided into independent business chain and basic chain that handle inter-operability between different business chain.
Dual layer basic chain provides services including the identity system, the consensus algorithm system, the smart contract system, the basic token and business token issuing and operation system, the file system, etc.
The business chain can be run through a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus algorithm using consortium chain or private chain when each business chain can record token status in its own ledger.
Dual layer basic chain supports the interaction of each business chain through a relay protocol to ensure fast and safe value exchanges. NPC, a trans-chain protocol, represents Constellation Protocol and is based on the queuing mechanism and Merkle Proof.
The NSC protocol is a token-issuing-and-operating protocol based on smart contracts. It also conforms to dual layer public chain standards. Developers can come up with their self-run organizations on dual layer public chain based on the NSC protocol. Since they follow the unified NSC protocol, safe value exchanges could be achieved as a result.
Dual layer public chain is run in the form of a relay protocol, which carries a multi-asset distributed ledger. Its status information includes the dual layer basic chain status and token status of each business chain.
Dual layer basic chain supports the deployment of public-chain smart contracts based on the NSC protocol. It also includes special contracts (consensus contracts, verifier contracts, cross-chain contracts, etc.) to support cross-chain consensus transactions, and cross-chain management contracts to support upgrading of the cross-chain protocol. The cross-chain contracts are packaged as gRPC services to simplify cross-chain transactions in business chain calls.
Business chain are independent blockchains, they are accessible to NPC protocol communications through dual layer basic chains.
8.4.2 Crosschain Protocol
The condition of realizing cross-chain transactions between a public chain and consortium chains is that they both agree on one protocol. We use NPC cross-chain protocol’s realization Cassini as an example.
A group of Cassini nodes connects to a public blockchain and its consortium chains. Each Cassini node holds all CAs of consortiums, while consortiums have Cassini’s public key to carry out the verification. Among Cassini nodes BFT consensus is applied to prevent cheating.
NPC Protocol：
Dual layer blockchain and any blockchain abiding by NPC protocol connect to the common Cassini relay;
Cassini subscribes to cross-chain events, fetches transaction abstract, carries out the 2/3 consensus, picks a trusted node to further obtain the transaction;

Once there is a new cross-chain transaction included in a block on dual layer public chain, it is placed in an outbox in an increasing order, the largest number is called sequence. Blockchain mechanically ensured the numbers is continuous;
Blockchain stores transactions received from Cassini in an inbox;
Cassini queries the sequence in this inbox, which is seq1, and reads transactions in dual layer public chain’s outbox whose number is larger than seq1. One or more transactions could be consumed each time;
Cassini nodes verify the transaction(s), perform 2/3 consensus and so on then route it(them) to the target blockchain(s).

8.4.3 Crosschain Transactions
Cross-chain transaction is achieved by adding two FIFO queues to a business chain. The queues guarantee authenticity of data by adopting Merkle Proof.
Cross-chain trading detailed steps:
Cassini listens to cross-chain events on-chain.
The chain appends key-value‘NPC.to=xxx’to structure Response DeliverTx’s Tags field. xxx is the name of the target chain.
Cassini then carries out 2/3 consensus on receiving this event.
Once 2/3 consensus is achieved, Cassini will call restful API(ABCI query) to query the transaction data.
With transaction data obtained, BFT consensus takes place among Cassini nodes, then the transaction will be submitted to the target chain through restful API(ABCI BroadcastTxAsync/BroadcastTxSync). After this, the whole cross-chain process is done.
Cross-chain transactions return results are the same as step a,b,c and d.
Framework of Cassini:

This framework applied adapter pattern, hence can be extended to and compatible with other chains, including future blockchains, if only they support NPC protocol.
Cross chain protocol is compatible with the ERC20 standards, which means that cross chain token technology could be applied in places where ERC20 tokens circulate. In this way, cross chain token enjoys better liquidity.
For instance, the exchange between two types of QSC tokens --- X-token and Y-token --- takes two steps:

In the dual layer public chain, for an X-token to be exchanged into a token that’s not used in the dual layer public chain, such as Ethereum, the transaction takes three steps:
